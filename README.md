# Azure Machine Learning - SDK for Python with Jupyter Notebooks

Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based platform provided by Microsoft that enables data scientists to build, deploy, automate and manage Machine Learning models, all at the broad scale that the Cloud environment provides. It offers a comprehensive set of tools and services to streamline the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.


The integration of a Jupyter Notebook within Azure ML empowers data scientists to utilize familiar coding environments for machine learning tasks. This environment is known as Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python, which allows you to create and run workflows with the Azure service in an IDE of your choice.

**In this lab, you will learn how to use Azure ML Python SDK to register, package and deploy a Machine Learning model to an Azure Container Instance as a scoring web service.**
